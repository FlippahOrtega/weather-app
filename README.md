# Technical Challenge

1. Build a serverless full stack application using the frameworks with which you feel best.
2. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
   - Run in AWS
   - Add User Registration Enable users for registration, authentication, and authorization for weather-app visitors to like and adopt, enabled through AWS API Gateway and its integration with Amazon Cognito.
   - Application must capture client location
   - Using weather API once the client has been registered or login successfully, it shows the weather based its location.
   
   - Application must store in a cloud database Outsource all weather-app data and preserve it with a managed NoSQL database provided by Amazon DynamoDB.
   - Unique User id
   - User PII form (First_Name/Last_Name/email)
   - Location
   - Timestamp
   Application must be responsive
   
   You will create and implement changes to this application completely programmatically. You will use the AWS command line interface to run commands that create the necessary infrastructure components, including a fully managed CI / CD stack through the use of AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline. Finally, you will complete all the necessary development tasks within your own browser by using the cloud-based IDE, AWS Cloud9.
